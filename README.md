# sabs_shop
An e-commerce shop that sells vintage handmade rugs

A simple, multi-page Python web application that allows users to register for an account, login,
search for items by name, add/remove items to their cart, and clear their cart.

I modeled an SQLite database to create a basic relationship between Users and the Items in their cart.

The frontend is styled with CSS & Bootstrap customization, and the backend uses Flask with Jinja templating.
